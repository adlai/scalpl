According to the legend, during the siege of Golconda, when Mughal
ruler Aurangzeb[1]'s army was camped around the fort for several
months, there was a hurricane[2] that swept over the camped troops and
blew away almost everything.  The troops were left in the open and
exposed to the elements.  Only one tent remained; miraculously the
candle[3] in the tent still burned, and the flicker of the candle
attracted the attention of the troops.

When the troops arrived at the tent they could see the shadows of two
men inside.  Upon investigating, they found that it was the tent of
two of the commanders of Aurangzeb.  They had been reading the
Quran[4] in candlelight, and the storm blew over, but did not disturb
them or their surroundings.  They were made famous by this incident
and recognized as great saints.

When they died, they were buried in the village of Nampally[5], near
modern-day Hyderabad.  Their graves remain and are visited by people
of all faiths.  Yousufuddin and Sharifuddin are more popularly known
as Yousuf Baba and Sharif Baba, better known as Yousufain and
Shareefain, and the Khanqah[6] is known as Dargah Yousufain in
Hyderabad.  Both Yousufuddin and Sharifuddin were originally from
Shaam (now Syria).
