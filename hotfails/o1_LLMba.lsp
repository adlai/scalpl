Here are some suggestions for a more intuitive name for the "hysteresis"
 variable in the context of your trading bot:

PriceDeltaThreshold – Indicates the threshold
 for price difference before updating offers.
UpdateThreshold – Simple and clear, focusing
 on when updates are triggered.
SpreadLag – Suggests a deliberate
 delay or lag in updating the spread.
RequoteTolerance – Represents
 the tolerance for requoting offers.
PriceUpdateBuffer – Implies a buffer
 that must be exceeded before updating prices.
AdjustmentThreshold – Focuses on the threshold
 for making adjustments to the offers.
RequoteHurdle – Suggests a hurdle
 that must be crossed before requoting.
LagThreshold – Emphasizes
 the delay aspect tied to a threshold.
OfferUpdateGap – Suggests the gap
 that must be exceeded to update offers.
UpdateDelayMargin –
 Combines delay and margin concepts clearly.

These names better convey the idea of a required
 gap, buffer, or threshold before the bot
  updates offers. Let me know which one
 aligns best with your needs!
