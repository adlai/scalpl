;;; Websocket

;;; there's a good chance that the sane priority is to leave the
;;; implementation of generic websocket functions until improving
;;; the hierarchical process control, sketched out in actor.lisp

;;; the alternative, where progress is made despite the Babylon
;;; of blocking bugs, unwritten specifications, and open sores,
;;; is to use this opportunity as a case study for the spec.
